 	<h2 style="font-size:30px; padding:30px"><strong>Getting Money for free - this sounds too good to be true?</strong></h2>
	
  <p style="font-size:20px; padding:30px; width:80%">Not at all, we do it by making a small commission every time you visit a company through our website which allows us to reward you in return. But we do this in the best possible way! By asking for smaller commissions from more eco companies we are encouragingÂ companies to become more sustainable to help save the environment. The eco-friendliness of a company is hard to judge but using criteria such as "how long until the company plans to become carbon neutral" is a good indication of the direction the company is taking.</p>

	<h2 style="font-size:30px; padding:30px"><strong>How would this work - companies will never sign up?</strong></h2>
	
  <p style="font-size:20px; padding:30px; width:80%"">Companies are willing to pay commissions for the advertisement they get through other website as this can be seen all over the internet. And since we are a not for profit organisation we can afford to give most of that commission back to the customers to make it worthwhile all round. But you may ask: some companies will never turn eco-friendly just to be on this small website? - this may be true but once we grow large enough it will force people to question why certain companies aren't on this website like other similar companies and pressure them into focusing more on their environmental impact</p>

  <h2 style="font-size:30px; padding:30px"><strong>What is the point of the extension?</strong></h2>

  <p style="font-size:20px; padding:30px; width:80%"">Even though the company as a whole might be sustainable - you don't know for sure whether the individual products you are buying are as well. Installing the extension means that you can see how far the product has to travel to you and it automatically calculates the product's carbon footprint</p>
